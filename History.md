__Saga Design Pattern__ (introduced to solve problems of managing Distributed Transactions)

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56720868/what-does-saga-stand-for

ACID is important.

Distributed Transaction - transactions performed across more than one service - database or data repository (consists of __local trnsactions__). There are also __compensating transactions__ to revert/rollback the __local transactions__ done previously in case of failure.

There are two common saga implementation approaches, __choreography and orchestration__.

Orchestration uses a state machine to manage transactions (tasks).
